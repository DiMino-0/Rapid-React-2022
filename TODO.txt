Ordered by when I thought of it:
    1. Climber subsystem
    2. Testing vision, linear regression for motor power @ whatever distance
    3. Add an LEDStrip subsystem to interact with our shooter, purly aesthetic
    4. Getting rid of this because we have Monday.com or something
    5. I have to configure the layout for shuffleboard, takes like 5 minutes i just need to deploy then enable for 
    about 2 seconds
